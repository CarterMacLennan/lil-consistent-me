### Description

Your Yeti is HUNGRY and the only way to feed him is by accomplishing your activities! These activities can be anything you want to be more consistent at. It doesn't matter whether its snowshoeing, reading, or making your bed; all that matters is he's hungry! Unfortunately, if you don't accomplish you activities not only will you miss out on accomplishing your goals, but he .... dies. 

By performing your activities not only does it give you health points, but level points as well! The amount of hp and lvl points you complete is dependent on how frequently you're performing the activity as well as the number of activities you're tracking. As you level up it gets incrementally harder. However, in the near future you will be able to unlock accessories for your Yeti as you level up!

By specifying the number of times a day/week that you want to perform your activity, you're able to visualize your daily and/or weekly progress! As well as monitor the number of days/weeks you reached your goals in a row, your longest streak, and your feature goals!

### Features
- Dynamic menu adjusts to number of tracking items.
- Calculates the magnitude that performing an activity has on the health and level bar based on the item's frequency and the current number of tracking items.
- Use gestures to navigate the menu.
- A health bar that decrements over one week. Increases by the magnitude specified on the menu item. When it reaches 0 the user may choose to continue or restart.
- Level bar that increments upon completing an activity. The magnitude is indicated on the menu item.
- Visualize the progress of performing your activity in the current period (day/week) to see if how many more times you must perform the activity before you reach your goal.
- Visualize the current number of consistent periods (days/weeks) that you've reached your goal.
- A quick tutorial on how to use the app upon starting the application for the first time.
- Long click a tracking item to remove it from the menu. 
- Dashboard containing an updated guide on how to use the application.
